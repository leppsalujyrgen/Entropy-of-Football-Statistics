# Entropy-of-Football-Statistics
In-depth analysis of football statistics. Finding interesting correlated attributes from dataset using frequent pattern mining techniques. Analyzing the capabilities of different machine learning models to correctly predict score and the winning team based on full-time match statistics.  

The data is taken from a github repository (https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League/). 
Although the name suggests it is about Fantasy Football, most of the statistics are from real world Premier League games.
The data used is from three Premier League seasons (2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19), in it are some of the more important games' 
statistics through which we can hopefully learn a model that has a meaningful rate of predicting the outcome of the games.\

Getting the results:\
Step one: Duplicating and modifying data files by running FileModifier.java\
Step two: Learning different classification and regression models in statistics-classifiers.ipynb and statistics-regression.ipynb
to get the initial idea of which model might be the best.\
Step three: Exploring correlations and impact between statistics.\
Step four: Applying found correlations and weight to statistics to get a model with better prediction rate.\
